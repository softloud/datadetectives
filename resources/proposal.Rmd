# Data Detectives

This workshop provides a problem-solving approach to exploring data visualisation in the `tidyverse`. It's for base`R`s who haven't had a chance to explore the `tidyverse`.  

With new visualisation tools rolling out at a breakneck pace, it is a challenge to stay up to date. With new techniques come new questions about best practice. As a group, we will share knowledge on how to answer questions visually and provide a forum to discuss best practice given these new techniques. 

This workshop will focus on the underlying principles of `ggplot`'s language of layers, rather than providing pre-scripted visualisations. Since visualisation often calls for wrangling, we will explore the `tidy` way of data wrangling for data vis, with `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages. 

Using wrangling, we can avoid the pitfall of letting data structure dictate the form of the visualisation. This workshop is for those who wish to share knowledge and ideas and/or learn about `tidy` vis.
